Results are in this folder. Final result of the model starting with 100 images and with a increment of 40 images per iteration is given under the name Test image.

When we trained on all of the images(i.e, approx 20,000 images), we were able to get a accuracy of 82.84%. This shows we can get very close results using Active leraning, while using fraction of the data.
